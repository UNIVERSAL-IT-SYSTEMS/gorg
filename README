How to install Gorg

Xavier Neys  Author

1. Introduction

Gorg allows you to serve your own local copy of http://www.gentoo.org. It can
use either a cgi or a fastcgi script with apache, or even use its own
stand-alone web server. Its name is short for Gentoo.org.

Of course, it can also be used in any other environment to apply XSL to some XML.

Gorg has been tested with the following packages:

Code Listing 1.1: Test environment

[ebuild   R   ] net-www/apache-2.0.53
[ebuild   R   ] net-www/mod_fcgid-1.05
[ebuild   R   ] dev-lang/ruby-1.8.2
[ebuild   R   ] dev-libs/fcgi-2.4.0
[ebuild   R   ] dev-ruby/ruby-fcgi-0.8.5-r1
[ebuild   R   ] dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.18
[ebuild   R   ] dev-libs/libxslt-1.1.13

Note: At the time of writing, mod_fcgid was not in Portage yet. Please see
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79313 for an ebuild

2. Installing Gorg

Download the gorg ebuild and drop it into your Portage overlay.

Compute its digest with ebuild gorg-0.5.ebuild digest. This command will
download the tarball automatically. Finally, run emerge gorg.

Gorg uses the apache2 and fastcgi USE flags.

3. Configuring Gorg

Configuring apache 

You may skip this section if you are not going to use apache at all.

If you want to use fastcgi, which you should anyway, you'll need to add -D
FCGID to the APACHE2_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/apache2.

Then, integrate the apache configuration directives from the provided sample
vhost configuration file /etc/gorg/vhost.sample into your own apache configuration.
Comments in the sample config file will guide you.

Configuring Gorg 

Create a copy of the sample config file /etc/gorg/gorg.conf.sample named /etc/
gorg/gorg.conf and edit it. Comments will help you define your own parameters.

If you do not want to use the default /etc/gorg/gorg.conf config file, you'll
need to define an environment variable called GORG_CONF that points to the
config file.

Getting the missing files 

Assuming you'll serve your local copy of CVS, or a copy if, or symlinks to it,
you need to download some files from the dyn directory.

Code Listing 3.1: Get the missing files

# cd to your htdocs directory
$ cd /path/to/your/document/root
/htdocs $ mkdir -p dyn/icons
/htdocs $ cd dyn
/htdocs $ wget -O news-index.xml http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/news-index.xml?passthru=1
# If you also want the icon pages
/htdocs $ wget -O icons.xml http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/icons.xml?passthru=1
/htdocs $ for FFF in `grep '\.xml"' icons.xml|sed 's:.*\([A-Z2]\{3\}\.xml\).*:\1:'`;do wget -O icons/$FFF http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/icons/$FFF?passthru=1;done
/htdocs $ cd ..
# If you ever need other data from the dyn pages,
# I am sure you get the picture on how to do it.


You also need to make the pictures available to your browser. The images
directory is one level above htdocs. Just define a symlink to it and you're
set.

Code Listing 3.2: Make a symlink to the pictures

/htdocs $ ln -si ../images images
# It should look like this:
/htdocs $ $ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x   3 neysx users  128 Sep 14 17:45 css
drwxr-xr-x  31 neysx users  744 Oct 26 00:03 doc
drwxr-xr-x   3 neysx users  544 Nov  2 16:53 dtd
drwxr-xr-x   3 neysx users  168 Nov  3 16:24 dyn
-rw-r--r--   1 neysx users 1406 Jun  7  2003 favicon.ico
lrwxrwxrwx   1 neysx users   10 Oct 21 22:29 images -> ../images/
-rw-r--r--   1 neysx users  190 Nov  9  2002 index.xml
drwxr-xr-x  16 neysx users  384 Apr  1  2004 main
drwxr-xr-x  17 neysx users 6960 Nov  3 15:34 news
drwxr-xr-x   8 neysx users  192 Oct 23 14:52 proj
drwxr-xr-x   4 neysx users   96 Sep 17 14:05 security
drwxr-xr-x   3 neysx users  736 Nov  2 16:40 xsl

# Your local CVS probably shows a few more entries, but at least
# those mentioned above should be available and kept up-to-date.
# Also remember to keep your images directory current.


4. Running Gorg

The stand-alone web server 

The easiest way to try it out is to run gorg. It should display something like:

Code Listing 4.1: Run Gorg

$ gorg


Starting the Gorg web server on port 8008

Hit Ctrl-C or type "kill 31479" to stop it


Point your browser to http://localhost:8008 and you should see your favourite
site.

With apache 

Restart apache (/etc/init.d/apache2 restart) and visit http://localhost
assuming you're installing on your own workstation.

If it doesn't work, try the stand-alone web server (type gorg). If this doesn't
work either, check your /etc/gorg/gorg.conf config file. If it does work,
please check your apache config files and your logs. Also check that the cache directory
defined in your gorg config file exists and is writable to your apache user.
If all fails, contact me.
