           Use PATH_TRANSLATED to resolve files in ~username

2004-12-16 Issue Etag and Last-Modified response headers fields
           Handle If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match request header fields
           Client caching will work in a consistent manner across several web nodes
           Set processed document mtime to latest mtime of dependent files and use it for Last-Modified
           Use timeouts when accessing cache (clean & store operations)
           Fork & Detach when cleaning up the cache
           Fix bugs:
             . in XSLT C extension when no document root is used
             . empty request params prevent use of cache

2005-01-10  Update Caching:
              . Use a dir tree under cache dir that is identical
                to the server tree. Some installations seem
                to have trouble with 30000+ files in one directory
                New param cacheTree = 1 activates this behaviour
              . Define MaxFiles param to limit number of files in one dir
              . Server will only try to clean the dir it caches to
              . Added -C (--clean-cache) option to gorg to clean whole cache tree with a cron job e.g.
2005-01-10  Add filter functionality:
              . Added -F (--filter) option to process STDIN
                Both gorg and gorg.cgi can be used as a filter.
                gorg.cgi needs the -F (--filter) option on its command line
                gorg will behave as a filter when no option are used *and* data is piped into it
              . Added -W (--web) Starting the web server is the default on the cmd line
                but it might need to be told when not started interactively

2005-04-04  . Trivial code cleanup to get rid of signal catching that was introduced
              before issues with mod_fastcgi and ruby-fcgi had been pinpointed.
            . wasCash can be set to 0 to disable cache cleaning, use `gorg --clean-cache` to clean up
            . xsl.c includes trivial patch that was applied the the -0.4.ebuild for 64-bit systems
            . ebuild now knows apache and fastcgi USE flags to depend on apache and fastcgi (mod-fcgid)

2005-07-04  . Pass parameter with path name of requested file (e.g. $link='/doc/en/index.xml')
            . Fix segfault when using a string stylesheet instead of a file
              (undocumented free in libxslt lead to a double free)
            . Issue http header with  text/html, text/xml or application/xhtml+xml as content-type,
              replace application/xhtml+xml with text/html if browser does not accept it
            . Stand-alone web server (ie. webrick) fails (500) like the (f)cgi versions when lib(xslt|xml2) return a warning
              It's just too confusing to have pages that work with "gorg &" generate errors once live with apache or lighttpd
            . Make stand-alone web server use index automatically when requesting a dir and index.xml exists
            . Add mount points for webrick (eg. for /cgi-bin or /images) to be handled by stock FileHandler (ie. not gorg)
            . xsl extension returns messages output with xsl:message that begin with '%%GORG%%'
            . Make xsl extension return requested remote file names (ftp:// & http://) and let
              caller decide how to handle caching of those resources
            . gorg has decided not to cache objects that request foreign URIs
            . Allow cookies to be passed to transforms and transforms to set cookies with
              xsl:message '%%GORG%%Set-Cookie(cookiename)key=value'
              eg.  <xsl:message>
                    <xsl:value-of select="concat('%%GORG%%Set-Cookie(prefs)SL=',$searchLang)"/>
                   <xsl:message>
              NOTE: Setting several cookies will not work properly in some cases with the stand-alone web server
                    http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2199&group_id=426&atid=1698
              *Update* My patch has been accepted upstream and should make it into an upcoming ruby release
            . Allow http redirect (301) with xsl:message '%%GORG%%Redirect=newURI'
            . Add charset= to http header for xml files what have encoding="bleh"
            . Deprecate zipCache param in favour of zipLevel (0-9) and add support for mod_gzip
              zipLevel makes gorg compress cached data *and* returned data if client requests it (accept_encoding=gzip)
              Decompressing compressed cached data to have it recompressed on output by apache with mod_deflate is a waste of CPU
              Besides, gorg can now be used with web servers that do not support deflating dynamic data (eg. lighttpd)
              In short, 0   == gorg does not compress data, neither in its cache nor its output
                               Of course, you may use mod_deflate or similar to make your web server support gzip encoding
                        1-9 == Compress data in cache and return zipped data if client supports it
                               Make sure your web server does not waste time compressing the data again
                               (apache looks clever enough and does not recompress as far as I know)
            . Pass host value from HTTP header as httphost param to the stylesheet
            . Return '<missing file="{filename}"/>' for missing files, no more
              Error 500, can be tested by your xsl or just ignored
            . Add search engine (uses mysql full text search)
            . Documents created with exsl:document under / are created inside
              the web site document root. Please note that the current directory
              is undefined and that docs created without a leading '/' in their
              path land wherever libxml2 decides to write them.

======================================================
           
2006-05-11 gorg-0.6.1 Maintenance release
            . chmod a+x search.cgi
            . Fix xsl.c to stat() file and not prepend $DocRoot when file
              exists. Apache expands ~username/file.xml to e.g.
              /home/username/public_html/file.xml and it should be searched
              under htdocs/...

======================================================
           
2006-06-19 gorg-0.6.2 Maintenance release
            . Fix xsl.c to prevent ruby exception on empty bodies

======================================================
           
2006-09-15 gorg-0.6.3 Maintenance release
            . Fix syntax error when looking for searched text and no text is
              found. Why MySQL matches those is not clear to me yet.
            . Don't bail out when cache dir is unusable. Just warn about it.
            . Force httphost to configured value even when no host is passed

======================================================
           
2009-10-17 gorg-0.6.4 Maintenance release
            . Fix Gentoo bug #289391 : missing file triggers cache miss
            . Fix bug with stand-alone webserver that returns empty content
              when cache store fails, e.g. no cache dir or not writable
            . Add Listen parameter to make stand-alone webserver listen on
              given address, 127.0.0.1 is the default value

======================================================
           
2012-10-26 gorg-0.6.5 Maintenance release
            . Compatibility fixes for Ruby 1.9

======================================================

2012-..-.. gorg-... 
            . Remove search support. It is not used on gentoo.org, and
	      it depends on the obsolete dbi code which does not work
	      with Ruby 1.9.
